# ProSPr-ThOr

This is the code base for a neural network that uses third-order Potts model parameters to predict protein structures.

The network uses A3M files generated by HHBlits (https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite).  The input feature generation mirrors TrRosetta's methods (https://github.com/gjoni/trRosetta).  In addition to the amino acid propensity and Pott's model parameters, this network uses third order coupling terms based off of https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2583-6.

Several of the dihederal angles are based off of TrRosetta's definitions and several are new.

Unfortunately, the network never properly learned how to predict protein structures.  The loss flattened out after a few thousand iterations.  The network may have some fundamental error or it may have just needed more time to learn.

The folding code is unfinished.
